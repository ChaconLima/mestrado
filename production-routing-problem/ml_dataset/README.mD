The directories contain all the instances and the solutions obtained by using the algorithms described  in  “Analysis of the Maximum Level Policy in a Production-Distribution System” by C. Archetti, L. Bertazzi, G. Paletta, and M.G. Speranza.

The directory  “DATI_14” contains the instances with  14 retailers and only one vehicle available,  the directory  “DATI_50” contains the instances with  50 retailers, while the directory  “DATI_100” contains the instances with  100 retailers. The directory  “RESULTS”  contains all the solution files.
